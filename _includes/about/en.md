# Work experience

## Guahao Co., LTd. ( June 2018 ~ present )



## Successinfo Technology Co., Ltd. (November 2016 ~ June 2018)

### The WeChat Mini program of the mall

Using `mpvue` to develop mini programs; responsible for project initialization, store home page, my order and other module development;

### The WeChat Mini program of the Fitness Room

Fully responsible for  developing small programs by `wePY`, the server is developed by `nodeJS` + `MySQL` , the management is developed by  `Vue-cli`.

### The YaoKe project

Maintaining the YaoKe project continuously; building a framework with `webpack` to improve the development efficiency, the developing period is significantly shorter than before.

### The HuaYang project

Using `vue@2.0` + `vue-router` + `vuex` + `webpack` to develop part of the function and interface of the HuaYang project.

### Other projects

The staged maintenance of the Wechat Official Accounts of Mary Kay (China), also contains liveShow and so on.

## Shanghai Yuli Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (January 2016 ~ November 2016)

### The good doctor of ibesteeth

Using `React` + `React-Router` + `Redux` + `webpack` to develop the whole project. For the first time I used `React`, there were many detours for me. The clearest memory is jointly adjusting with native and the problem of taking the value form `localStorage`. `Android` is asynchronous in this question.

### The client and management of ibesteeth

Using `php` to develop the  front-end and interface integration. The most difficult part in it is to add the project in client. It should use `clone` and a large number of judgments to verify the solution.

### Other projects

The development of web pages embedded in ibesteeth APP

## Jiashi software Co., Ltd. (July 2014 ~ December 2015)

### Haier store management mobile terminal

Developing the `WorkLight` platform based on IBM, whose main technology stack is `backbone` + `cordova` + `jQuery Mobile` etc.

It’s my first time to encounter the hybrid project, problems seemed to be a bit more but they were solved in our overnight overtime. Simultaneously, it was a coincidence for me to write `android`.

### The waste exchange system of the Wuxi Environmental Protection Bureau

It’s a `javaweb` project. I served as the project leader, was responsible for project building (SSM) and some modules’ development. The main problem I encountered was the online preview document which was finally solved by `OpenOffice`.

### Other projects

China blue entertainment APP ( `angularJs@1.0` ) and so on.
