> Follow the heart

I am Seaton Wang, graduated in 2015.

Java was my major in the university, but when I was touch with [Worklight](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mobile/mo-aim1206-working-with-worklight-1/), [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), etc.,
 doing the related projects, I fully found my strong interest in Web.
 
 Therefore, I changed my profession to Web, and focused on it completely.
